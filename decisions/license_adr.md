# ADR: Choose MIT License

## Context
We need a permissive open source license for the project. The MIT License is short and well understood, while alternatives like Apache 2.0 or BSD 3-Clause provide similar permissions with varying complexity.

## Decision
Adopt the MIT License for this repository. This balances permissive reuse with minimal overhead and is widely recognized in the open source community.
